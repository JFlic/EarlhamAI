# Earlham AI Streaming Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds streaming capabilities to the Earlham AI chatbot, allowing users to see responses as they are generated in real-time instead of waiting for the complete response.

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users see responses immediately as they're generated
- **Perceived Performance**: Reduces perceived wait time from 8+ seconds to near-instant
- **Better Engagement**: Users can start reading while the AI is still generating
- **Fallback Support**: Maintains compatibility with the original non-streaming endpoint

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **New Streaming Endpoint**: `/query/stream`
   - Uses FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Processes queries asynchronously and streams chunks as they become available
   - Maintains the same RAG pipeline but with streaming LLM responses

2. **Streaming Function**: `process_query_streaming()` in `Retrieve.py`
   - Yields different types of data: sources, content chunks, metadata, and completion signals
   - Handles language detection, vector search, and streaming LLM generation
   - Maintains error handling and resource cleanup

### Frontend Changes

1. **Streaming Support**: Updated JavaScript to handle streaming responses
   - Uses `fetch()` with `ReadableStream` to process streaming data
   - Real-time content display with animated cursor
   - Graceful fallback to regular endpoint if streaming fails

2. **User Interface**:
   - Animated blinking cursor during streaming
   - Progressive content display
   - Sources displayed after content completion
   - Maintains existing styling and functionality

## API Endpoints

### Streaming Endpoint
```
POST /query/stream
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "Tell me about City Council"
}
```

**Response**: Server-Sent Events stream with JSON data:
```json
data: {"type": "start", "user_id": "uuid"}
data: {"type": "sources", "sources": [...]}
data: {"type": "content", "content": "chunk of text"}
data: {"type": "metadata", "metadata": {...}}
data: {"type": "done"}
```

### Regular Endpoint (Fallback)
```
POST /query/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "Tell me about City Council"
}
```

**Response**: Complete JSON response (existing functionality)

## Configuration

The frontend can be configured to use streaming or regular responses:

```javascript
const config = {
    apiEndpoint: 'https://questionroddixon.com/query/',
    streamEndpoint: 'https://questionroddixon.com/query/stream',
    useStreaming: true, // Set to false to disable streaming
    timeout: 30000
};
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify streaming functionality:

```bash
python test_streaming.py
```

This will test both the streaming and regular endpoints and show timing comparisons.

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Full streaming support with `ReadableStream`
- **Older Browsers**: Automatic fallback to regular endpoint
- **Mobile**: Streaming works on modern mobile browsers

## Performance Impact

- **Backend**: Minimal overhead, same processing time
- **Frontend**: Improved perceived performance
- **Network**: Same total data transfer, just delivered incrementally
- **Memory**: Lower memory usage as content is displayed progressively

## Error Handling

- **Network Issues**: Automatic fallback to regular endpoint
- **Streaming Errors**: Graceful error display with retry options
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts for both endpoints
- **Browser Compatibility**: Automatic detection and fallback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Typing Indicators**: Show when AI is "thinking"
2. **Progress Bars**: Visual progress indication
3. **Chunk Size Optimization**: Fine-tune streaming chunk sizes
4. **Compression**: Add gzip compression for streaming responses
5. **Metrics**: Add streaming performance metrics

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure your web server supports streaming responses
2. Configure appropriate CORS headers for streaming
3. Test with various network conditions
4. Monitor streaming performance in production
5. Consider rate limiting for streaming endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Streaming Not Working**: Check browser console for errors, verify endpoint URL
2. **Slow Streaming**: Check network connection, server performance
3. **Incomplete Responses**: Verify LLM streaming configuration
4. **CORS Issues**: Ensure proper CORS headers for streaming endpoints

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in the frontend:
```javascript
// Add to browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

This will show detailed streaming information in the console.
